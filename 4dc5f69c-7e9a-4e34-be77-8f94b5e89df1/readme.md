### üìÅ„ÉªSetting up the RAT
1. Start off by ofc installing [python](https://www.python.org/)
2. do `git clone https://github.com/Rdimo/DiscordRAT.git` and open a cmd in the same directory and type `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Now time to get the bot token, follow this guide [here](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token) on how to do that
4. After you got your token you need to enable intents for the bot

5. Go into main.py
   - go to where it says `token = 'BOT_TOKE_HERE'` (line 35)
     - Replace `BOT_TOKE_HERE` with your bot token that you got from the [developer page](https://discord.com/developers)
       - go to where it says `g = [GUILD_ID_HERE]` (line 36)
         - Replace `GUILD_ID_HERE` with the id of your server that you want the bot to be in ([server id?](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID))
6. Now your ready to invite your bot to your server, go to the the [developer page](https://discord.com/developers) and go to the page `OAuth2` and enable these options

8. When your done with all of that, simply open **build-exe.bat** and enter a name for the exe and now your done!

### üéâ„ÉªCredits
Although this discord rat was created by me (Rdimo#6969) the original is https://github.com/Sp00p64/DiscordRAT and credits goes to him and his discord rat. His is quite old and uses message event to execute his commands so thought I would do slash commands and added/improved/removed some commands aswell. Additionally some code for the commands belong to him
