Usage
-----

This cog contains commands used for "cleaning up" (deleting) messages.

This is designed as a moderator tool and offers many convenient use cases.
All cleanup commands only apply to the channel the command is executed in.

Messages older than two weeks cannot be mass deleted.
This is a limitation of the API.
