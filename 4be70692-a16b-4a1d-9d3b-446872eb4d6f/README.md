# discordbot-search-engine
Open terminal and cd into the directory where you put this discord_bot.py and put in the command "python3 discord_bot.py".
Note you will have to have your own bot token inserted into the python file (discord_bot.py)

The bot can search Google from within Discord, it has Google translate build in (Google translate isn't good, but it's the best I have found). 

You might need to install dependencies from pip or pip3 (depending on which you use), such as pip3 install googletrans and pip3 install google

There is a list of imorts at the top, and some of those need to be installed by pip.
