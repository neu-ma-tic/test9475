# Dapper Dino Discord Server Bot

Hello everyone, here is where you'll find my project where I am creating a Discord bot for my server to have the usual functionality of commands and events like any other Discord bot whilst also eventually adding the functionality to be able to connect with the backend of my upcoming website so that certain aspects of the Discord server will be linked online, such as leaderboards and FAQ's. The code is here so that anyone (mainly people from my server) can see how it all works and they can then impliment similar funcitonality in their own creations.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For this project you will need to install node.js and a few additional libraries via the console of your project:

```
To install node.js: npm init
To install discord.js: npm install discord.js
To install superagent: npm install superagent
```

### Installing

To set up this for yourself you will need to have already created a bot account on the discord app development website.

Set up tasks:

```
1. Create bot account on the discord app development website
2. Find your bot's token when you have created its account
3. Add your bot to your desired server (this is explained on the discord app development website)
4. Use your own token in the bot.login("Your Token") to allow your code to connect to the bot's account
5. Replace all 'config.' parts of the script with your own values due to them being dependant on the server being used
```

Then run the bot with 'node .' in the console window and hope for the best :D
