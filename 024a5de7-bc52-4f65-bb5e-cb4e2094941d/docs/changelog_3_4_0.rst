Read before updating
--------------------

1. PM2 process manager is no longer supported as it is not a viable solution due to certain parts of its behavior.

    We highly recommend you to switch to one of the other supported solutions:
        - `autostart_systemd`
        - `autostart_mac`

    If you experience any issues when trying to configure it, you can join `our discord server <https://discord.gg/red>`__ and ask in the **support** channel for help.
2. Information for Audio users that are using an external Lavalink instance (if you don't know what that is, you should skip this point):

    - Red 3.4.10 uses a new Lavalink jar that you will need to manually update from `our GitHub <https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Lavalink-Jars/releases/tag/3.3.2.3_1233>`__.
    - We've updated our `application.yml file <https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/blob/3.4.10/redbot/cogs/audio/data/application.yml>`__ and you should update your instance's ``application.yml`` appropriately.

Read before updating
--------------------

1. Information for Audio users that are using an external Lavalink instance (if you don't know what that is, you should skip this point):

    Red 3.4.4 uses a new Lavalink jar that you will need to manually update from `our GitHub <https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Lavalink-Jars/releases/tag/3.3.2.2_1170>`__.

2. Ubuntu 16.04 is no longer supported as it will soon reach its end of life and it is no longer viable for us to maintain support for it.

    While you might still be able to run Red on it, we will no longer put any resources into supporting it. If you're using Ubuntu 16.04, we highly recommend that you upgrade to the latest LTS version of Ubuntu.
