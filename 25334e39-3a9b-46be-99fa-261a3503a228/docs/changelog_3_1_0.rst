----------------------
Mongo Driver Migration
----------------------

Due to the required changes of the Mongo driver for Config, all existing Mongo users will need to
complete the below instructions to continue to use Mongo after updating to 3.1.
This includes **all** users, regardless of any prior migration attempt to a development version of
3.1.

 #. Upgrade to 3.1
 #. Convert all existing Mongo instances to JSON using the new converters
 #. Start each bot instance while using JSON and load any and all cogs you have in order to successfully preserve data.
 #. Turn each instance off and convert back to Mongo.
    **NOTE:** No data is wiped from your Mongo database when converting to JSON.
    You may want to use a *new* database name when converting back to Mongo in order to not have duplicate data.

-------------
Setup Utility
-------------

New commands were introduced to simplify the conversion/editing/removal process both on our end and the users end.
Please use ``redbot-setup --help`` to learn how to use the new features.

.. HINT::

    Converting to JSON: ``redbot-setup convert <instance_name> json``

    Converting to Mongo: ``redbot-setup convert <instance_name> mongo``
