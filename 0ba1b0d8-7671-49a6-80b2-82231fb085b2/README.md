### Installing the dependencies

`npm i`

### Setup

Make a config.json file in the root directory of the project and add:

- Minimum

```
{
  "prefix": "!",
  "discord_owner_id": "Your-Discord-ID",
  "token": "Your-Bot-Token",
  "youtubeAPI": "youtube-api-key"
}
```

- Full Command List

```
{
  "invite": "false",
  "prefix": "!",
  "discord_owner_id": "Your-Discord-ID",
  "token": "Your-Bot-Token",
  "youtubeAPI": "youtube-api-key",
  "geniusLyricsAPI": "genius-api-key",
  "tenorAPI": "tenor-API-key",
  "newsAPI": "news-api-key",
  "twitchClientID": "Your-Client-ID",
  "twitchClientSecret": "Your-Client-Secret",
  "rawgAPI": "rawg-api-key"

}
```

Note: When setting `"invite": true` remember to enable the Public Bot option in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)

I run the bot on a debian 9 environment so it might not work as intended on other operating systems(although it should), if you need a guide on how to install node.js on debian 9 or ubuntu I will link one in the resources down below.

Also, no matter what operating system you have, make sure [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed. **Make sure that your Node.js version is v14 at least.** .

If you are not cloning this repo, make sure your dependencies versions are the same as this repo's.
