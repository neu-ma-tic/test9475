        - `autostart_systemd`
        - `autostart_mac`

    If you experience any issues when trying to configure it, you can join `our discord server <https://discord.gg/red>`__ and ask in the **support** channel for help.
2. Information for Audio users that are using an external Lavalink instance (if you don't know what that is, you should skip this point):

    - Red 3.4.10 uses a new Lavalink jar that you will need to manually update from `our GitHub <https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Lavalink-Jars/releases/tag/3.3.2.3_1233>`__.
    - We've updated our `application.yml file <https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/blob/3.4.10/redbot/cogs/audio/data/application.yml>`__ and you should update your instance's ``application.yml`` appropriately.

2. This Red update bumps discord.py to version 1.5.1, which explicitly requests Discord intents. Red requires all Privileged Intents to be enabled. More information can be found at :ref:`enabling-privileged-intents`.
3. Mutes functionality has been moved from the Mod cog to a new separate cog (Mutes) featuring timed and role-based mutes. If you were using it (or want to start now), you can load the new cog with ``[p]load mutes``. You can see the full `Mutes changelog below <important-341-1>`.
4. Information for Audio users that are using an external Lavalink instance (if you don't know what that is, you should skip this point):

   We've updated our `application.yml file <https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/blob/3.4.1/redbot/cogs/audio/data/application.yml>`__ and you should update your instance's ``application.yml`` appropriately.
   Please ensure that the WS port in Audio's settings (``[p]llset wsport``) is set to the port from the ``application.yml``.
