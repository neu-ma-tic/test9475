# DiscordBot

***This app was created following a freeCodeCamp guide.***

With this discord bot each time a word related to sadness appears in the chat it will prompt a cheerful message.
I developed this app to learn how to use the discord.py package and practicing decorators and helper functions.

To run this app on your pc you need to have python and pip installed. Then use pip to install discord.py, that should be it for the local setup, but for further instructions check out https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-python/   

*In Discord* commands:

- $inspire prompts a random inspiring quote. Eg:
> $inspire   
> To be or not to be, that is the question. -William Shakespeare
