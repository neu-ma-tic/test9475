# Disclaimer

## 1. Riot Accounts. 
 
You hold yourself accountable if you are to use bots hosted using code from Valorant-DiscordBot with your Riot Account, which may cause your account to be banned/suspended by Google. As per [**Valorant's Developer API Policy**](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/valorant): 

Valorant-DiscordBot is not endorsed by Riot Games and does not reflect the views or opinions of Riot Games or anyone officially involved in producing or managing Riot Games properties. Riot Games and all associated properties are trademarks or registered trademarks of Riot Games, Inc.
 
### Valorant Game Policy
 
> **Examples of Unapproved Use Cases**
>
> The following use cases will not be approved:
>
>    - Scouting, which is seeing an opponents stats before a match starts.
>    - Apps that are not public and are designed for personal use only.
>    - Online store tracking or updates. The technology for this does not currently exist in the API.

The `/store` command specifically violates this Use-Case, therefore exposing your account at risk for a ban or suspension. Until Riot decides to release official API endpoints for store checking, this method will remain "unapproved".
